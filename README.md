# 🔐 SecureText

**SecureText** is a lightweight C++ desktop application built with the **wxWidgets GUI framework**, designed for secure encryption and decryption of text files. It provides users with a simple interface to load `.txt` files, apply encryption or decryption using secure algorithms, and save the results with ease.

## ✨ Features

- 🔒 **Encryption & Decryption** of `.txt` files
- 🧠 Uses **Vigenère Cipher** and **Reverse Cipher**
- 🗂️ File-based input/output with custom key support
- 🪟 Built using **wxWidgets** for a clean GUI experience

---

## 🛠 Requirements

- **C++ Compiler** (e.g., g++, MSVC)
- **wxWidgets** library installed and linked properly

> 🔧 Make sure wxWidgets is configured correctly on your system before building.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Build the project using your preferred IDE or CMake setup with wxWidgets linked.

2. Run the compiled application.

---

## 📂 How It Works

* Load a `.txt` file.
* Enter a **key** and choose to **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**.
* The app processes the text using:
  * **Vigenère Cipher** for secure key-based substitution.
  * **Reverse Cipher** for added complexity.
* Save the output to a new file.
